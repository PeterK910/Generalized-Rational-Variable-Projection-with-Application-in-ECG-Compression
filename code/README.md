- **Code** contains various algorithms for approximating ECG signals using adaptive wavelets [2], B-splines [3], Hermite functions [4], and rational functions [5]. Each directory contains an *example.m* script, which demonstrates the algorithms step by step. These demonstrations are also available in pdf format. The animations in *VarPro_demos.pdf* work in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
- **Data** some real ECG signals are stored in this directory.
- **Results** includes the figures generated by the scripts.
